The "arrugado" is a concept describing the rugged, wrinkled appearance of certain geographical features, often used to describe areas with undulating terrain or mountainous landscapes.
"Arrugado" typically refers to something that is wrinkled or crumpled in Spanish. However, there is no specific geographic feature widely known or recognized by this name. It might be a local or informal name for a landscape feature characterized by a ridge or folded terrain, but more context is needed to identify a specific place.
