Each religious order or tradition may have novitiates, and there isn't a universal list or single 'novitiate' name. However, a novitiate refers to a period or place of training for new members of a religious order. For example, the 'Jesuit Novitiate of St. Stanislaus Kostka' in the United States is one specific novitiate for those joining the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).
