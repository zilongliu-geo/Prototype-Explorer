Quicksand is not typically named like geographic features such as mountains or rivers, as it is a natural phenomenon that can occur in various locations. It forms in saturated, loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated, causing it to behave like a liquid. Quicksand can be found near riverbanks, beaches, marshes, and other areas where water saturates loose sand or silt.
