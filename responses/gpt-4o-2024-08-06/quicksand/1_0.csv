Quicksand can occur in various locations rather than being specific to one named place. It typically forms in certain conditions where fine sand, silt, or granular soil becomes saturated with water, losing its solidity and becoming a trap for objects or individuals that apply force on it. Commonly found near rivers, lakes, beaches, marshes, or even construction sites, quicksand does not have a specific geographic name like mountains or rivers do. It's recognized by the nature of the terrain and its characteristics.
